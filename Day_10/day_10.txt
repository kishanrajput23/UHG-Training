1. Paranthesis checker: 
Check whether the given expression is valid or not (only parenthesis symbol).

Test Case: 1
Input: "(( ))"
Output: Valid

Test Case: 2
Input: "(("
Output: Invalid

2. Print the pattern If input is 5
1
3*2
4*5*6
10*9*8*7
11*12*13*14*15

3. Count the number of co-prime pairs in an array. (Any two numbers whose GCD is 1 are be called as co-prime)

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, total number of elements. Then follow T elements.

Output:
Count the number of co-prime pairs in an array.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 25
1 ≤ elements ≤ 100

Sample Input and Output:

Input:
1 2 3
Output:
3
Here, Co-prime pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)

Input:
4 8 3 9
Output:
4
Here, Co-prime pairs are (4, 3), (8, 3), (4, 9 ), (8, 9 )

4. Search index in a sorted array:
Program to find the target value in a two-dimensional matrix.

Input and Output:
Get a target element and return its coordinates. If the value didn't exist, the program had to return (-1,-1). 
First line of input is size of row and column, followed rc elements. 
The third line of input is the element to be searched in the rxc matrix.

Sample Input and Output:

Input 1:
4 2
0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
3
Output 1:
(3, 1)
