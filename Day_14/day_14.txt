1. Given as string S(input consisting) of '*' and '#'. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of '*' or '#' to make it a valid string. 
The string is considered valid if the number of '#' and '*' are equal.  The '#' and '*' can be at any position in the string.

Note: The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of '#' and '*' in input string.

(*>#) : positve integer
(#>*) : negative integer
(#=*) : 0

Example :
Input : ###***
output : 0

Explanation : As count of * and # are equal therefore output is 0

2. A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here represent an array arr of N number of integer values. 
The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the convevor belt(array).

For Example
N=7 and arr = [4,5,0, 1.9,0,5,0].
There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array.

Example 1:
Input: 7 --> Value of N
     [4,5,0,1,0,0,5] --> Element of array

Output : [4,5,1,5,0,0,0]

Example 1:
Input: 6 --> Value of N
     [6,0,1,8,0,2] --> Element of array

Output : [6,1,8,2,0,0,]

3. An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:
1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler) = V
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
Example :
Input :
200  -> Value of V
540   -> Value of W

Output :
TW =130 FW=70

Explanation:
130+70 = 200 vehicles
(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

Constraints :
2<=W
W%2=0
V<W

Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

The input format for testing :
The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.
First Input line – Accept value of V.
Second Input line - Accept value for W.

The output format for testing :
Written program code should generate two outputs, each separated by a single space character(see the example)
Additional messages in the output will result in the failure of test case.

4. Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. 
Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is “A positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. 
Print the positive integer value after toggling all bits”.

Constraints :
1<=N<=100

Example 1:
Input :
10  -> Integer
Output :
5    -> result- Integer

Explanation:
Binary representation of 10 is 1010. After toggling the bits(1010), will get 0101 which represents “5”. 
Hence output will print “5”.

5. Jack is always excited about Sunday. It is his favourite day when he gets to play all day. And goes cycling with his friends.
So whenever the month starts he counts the number of Sundays he will get to enjoy. Considering the month can start with any day, be it Sunday, Monday…. Or so on.
Count the number of Sunday jack will get within n number of days.

Example 1:
Input :
mon-> input String denoting the start of the month.
13 -> input integer denoting the number of days from the start of the month.

Output :
2 -> number of days within 13 days.

Explanation :
The month starts on Mon (Monday). So the upcoming Sunday will arrive in the next 6 days. And then next Sunday in the next 7 days and so on.
Now the total number of days is 13. It means 6 days to the first Sunday and then the remaining 7 days will end up on another Sunday. 
A total of 2 Sundays may fall within 13 days.
