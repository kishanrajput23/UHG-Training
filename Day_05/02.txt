--> What is difference between const char * and char * const.

The difference is that const char * is a pointer to a const char, while char * const is a constant pointer to a char.

const char * :- In this, the value being pointed to can’t be changed but the pointer can be.
char  * const :- In this, the value being pointed at can change but the pointer can’t.
