--> Real life example to explain types of inheritance.

There are five types of inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multilevel Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

#1 Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, a class derives from one base class only. This means that there is only one subclass that is derived from one superclass.

#2 Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class derives from more than one class. 
In a real-life scenario, a child inherits from their father and mother. This can be considered an example of multiple inheritance.

#3 Multilevel Inheritance
In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class. This inheritance can have as many levels as long as our implementation doesnâ€™t go wayward.

#4 Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is usually a combination of more than one type of inheritance.

#5 Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, more than one class inherits from a single base class.
