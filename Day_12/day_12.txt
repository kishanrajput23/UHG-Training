1. Security Key

Description: A company is transmitting data to another server. The data is in the form of numbers. To secure the data during transmission, they plan to obtain a security key that will be sent along with the data. 
The security key is identified as the count of the repeating digits in the data.

Write an algorithm to find the security key for the data.

Input:
The input consists of an integer data, representing the data to be transmitted

Output:
Print an integer representing the security key for the given data. If no data is repeated it should

Example
Input : 578378923
Outout: 3

Eyplanation: The repeated digits in the data are 7, 8 and 3. So, the security key is 3.

2. Encode as Number

Description : A company wishes to encodes its data. The data is in the form of a number. They wish to encode the data with respect to a specific digit. 
They wish to count the number of times the specific digit reoccurs in me given data so that they can encode the data accordingly. 

Write an algorithm to find the count of the specitic digit in the given data.

Input:
The input consists of two space-separated integers- data and digit, representing the data to be
encoded and the digit to be counted in the data.

Output:
Print an integer representing the count of the specific digit.

Example
Input:  572378233 3
Outout: 3

Explanation: The digit 3 is repeated three times in the data. So the output is 3.

3. Sum of Adjacent Distances

Description: Write a program to calculate and return the sum of distances between the adjacent numbers in an array or positive integers.

Note: You are expected to write code in the find Total distance function only which receive the first parameter as the number of items in the array, 
and second parameter as the array itself. You are not requested to take input from the console

Example
Finding the total distance between adjacent items of a list of 5 numbers
Input:
5
10 11 7 12 14

Output:
12

Explanation: The first parameters (5) is the size of the array next is an array of integers the total of distance is
12 as per the calculation below.
10-11=1
11-7=4
7-12=5
12-14=2
Total distance.1+4+5+2=12

4. Odd Even Online Game

Description: You are playing an online game. In the game, a list of N numbers is given. The player has to arrange the numbers so that all the odd numbers of the list come after the even numbers.

Write an algorithm to arrange the given list such that all the odd numbers of the list come after the even numbers.

Input:
The first line of the input consists of an integer num, representing the size of the list (N).
The second line of the input consists of N space-separated integers representing the values of the list.
Output:
Print N space-separated integers such that all the odd numbers of the list come after the even numbers

Example
Input:  10 98 3 33 12 22 21 11
Output: 10 98 12 22 3 33 21 11

Explanation: All the even numbers are placed before all the odd numbers.
