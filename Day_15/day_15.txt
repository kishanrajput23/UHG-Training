1. Read heights of all students in a class and arrange them in ascending order by satisfying the following conditions.

(i) Use a function int find_min(int[], int) to find the smallest number from an array.

(ii) Use int get_index(int[], int, int) to find index of a particular number from an array.

(iii) Also verify entered variables 'number of students' and 'heights' are integer numbers or not.

2.  Write a C++ program to create a class called Triangle that has private member variables for the lengths of its three sides. Implement member functions to determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

3. Write a C++ program to implement a class called Employee that has private member variables for name, employee ID, and salary. Include member functions to calculate and set salary based on employee performance. Use operator overloading concepts.

4. Write a C++ program to implement a class called Shape with virtual member functions for calculating area and perimeter. Derive classes such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle from the Shape class and override virtual functions accordingly.

5. Create your own code to explain the use of abstract class concept.

6. Write a program to find frequency of each element in a vector using map.

7. WAP to find intersection of sets.Example ,consider 3 sets {1,3,5,5,6,7},{3,4,5,5,6,9},{1,2,3,5,5,10}. The intersection of these set is {3,5,5,}.
